This repository contains some of my code-snippets.

This python script is inspired by Nek5000's genbox tool for simple mesh generation
I want to use it to create a simple mesh for roughness simulations 
Therefore, periodic boundary conditions and internal BCs need to be prescribed in multiple boxes
